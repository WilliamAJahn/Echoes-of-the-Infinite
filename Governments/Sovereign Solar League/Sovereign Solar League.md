The Sovereign Solar League (SSL) is a constitutional monarchy and interstellar political entity centered in the Sol System with its capital on Earth. Established in 2112 during humanity's early expansion into space, the League represents a unique synthesis of hereditary monarchy and representative democracy, maintaining Earth's preeminence while incorporating its off-world colonies into a unified political structure.
